# Getting files recursively by chaining iterators

This repos contains a single Python source file, `get_files_recursively.py`, 
that demonstrates how to use the itertools.chain function to iterate through a
folder recursively and to retrieve all the file name.

The file `setup.sh` sets up a directory tree for testing the
`get_files_recursively` script. The file `cleanup.sh` cleans up the directory
tree after testing.
